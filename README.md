# complete-devops-ci-cd-pipeline
A complete DevOps CI/CD pipeline to automate build, test, deployment, and monitoring of applications using GitHub, Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes, Prometheus, and Grafana on cloud infrastructure.
I built a complete DevOps CI/CD pipeline that automates build, test, deployment, and monitoring using Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes, Prometheus, and Grafana.
# Complete DevOps CI/CD Pipeline

This project implements a complete DevOps CI/CD pipeline to automate application build, testing, deployment, and monitoring.

## Tools Used
- GitHub
- Jenkins
- Docker
- Kubernetes
- Prometheus
- Grafana
- AWS/GCP

## Workflow
1. Code pushed to GitHub
2. Jenkins pipeline triggered
3. Build and test executed
4. Docker image created and pushed
5. Kubernetes deployment updated
6. Monitoring via Prometheus
7. Visualization via Grafana

## How to Run
- Configure Jenkins
- Add Docker & Kubernetes credentials
- Run pipeline
  🔹 Issues / Tasks
1. Setup Jenkins server
2. Configure GitHub webhook
3. Create Dockerfile
4. Write Jenkinsfile
5. Setup Kubernetes cluster
6. Deploy application
7. Configure Prometheus
8. Setup Grafana dashboards

PROJECT ROADMAP (Step-by-Step)
Step 1: Developer pushes code to GitHub
Step 2: Jenkins pipeline triggers automatically
Step 3: Jenkins builds the application
Step 4: Jenkins runs tests
Step 5: Docker image is created
Step 6: Image pushed to Docker Hub
Step 7: Kubernetes deploys the app
Step 8: Prometheus monitors metrics
Step 9: Grafana visualizes metrics
